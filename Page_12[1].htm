<font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="yellow">Tulsi Meher Shrestha was the only child of his family who was inspired by reading
the book of Maharshi Dayanand "The Light of Truth" Tulsi Mehar brought himself
changes in his own life. His self realization about the truth and observation of 
self-disciplined was the key message he was delivering to the mass people. In those 
early days when country was in the grips of the autocrat Rana regime when people 
were not allowed to educate and to express their views freely Late Tulsi Mehar Shrestha
dared to disseminate the messages to the society about the importance of self awareness 
and urged to wake up against ignorance and evil of the society. He began appearing
into the public and advocating on the wicked side of prevalent religion specially 
against rigid caste system and oppression of people especially women.His vision 
towards social reform and development was to emphasize on women's empowerment
and for which he was propagating about the need of education of women and income
generation program to make women economically self-reliant. It looked simple but 
was very tough at that time when women were observing "Parda" vail system and 
motivating and driving women to economic activities was the heroic activities at those
days.<br>
Because of Tulsi Mehar's such deeds the then Prime Minister Chandra Shumsher
Junga Bahadur Rana charged him as an anti-national and awarded punishment of
either life imprisonment or life long exile. Filled by far sighted mind and vision, 
Tulsi Mehar decided to accept life long exile since he thought he could not do
anything for the country if would he be rotted inside the wall of the jail, so he 
pleaded the prime minister to have him sent for exile.<br>
Today he is popularly regarded as <i>"Gandhi of Nepal"</i> or <i>"Nepalese Gandhi"</i>.
