<font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="yellow">Dor Bahadur Bista was born in 1926 in Jaruwarasi, a village south of Patan, 
the son of an army man. After graduating from Patan High School, he attended 
Trichandra College. In 1952 he took a government job as the first headmaster
 of a girl’s high school in Patan. For several years he worked in education,
 including assignments at Dhandeldhura in the west and Biratnagar in the east.
 He also became headmaster of the Normal School at the College of Education. 
While there, an unexpected opportunity came along, one that put him on the path
 to becoming the country’s first anthropologist.
