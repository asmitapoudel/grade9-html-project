<font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="red">Sukra Raj Sastri was a Nepalese intellectual and fighter for democracy 
who became a martyr.He was one of the four martyrs of the revolution
that brought down the Rana dynasty in Nepal.Madhav Raj was a leader
of the Arya Samaj in Nepal, and was forced to live in exile in India for 
political reasons.Sukra Raj was schooled in India, and he acquired the title
Shastri after earning a Shastri degree from Dehradun. He became better known 
by this name than his actual surname Joshi.He was also a social reformer and 
author who wrote a number of books in Nepali and Nepal Bhasa.<br>
Shastri was one of the leaders of the Nepal Bhasa renaissance.He wrote a grammar
of the language entitled Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran which was published from Kolkata 
in 1928. He was the first to produce children's literature. His other works include
Nepal Bhasa Reader, Books 1 and 2 (1933) and Nepali Varnamala (1933).<br>
He and the other martyrs are honored on Martyrs Day which is observed annually 
on 30<sup>th</sup>January across the country.Shukra Path, a street in downtown 
Kathmandu, is named after him.Shastri's statues have been erected at a number of places,
and the Postal Service Department has issued commemorative postage stamps depicting 
his image. A monument known as Shahid Gate containing the busts of the four martyrs
and King Tribhuvan was built in central Kathmandu in 1961.
It is believed that Shastri was executed for his work to develop his mother tongue Nepal
Bhasa more than his involvement in politics. Shastri did not belong to any political party
unlike the other three martyrs.</font>
