Anuradha Koirala is a social activist and the founder and director of Maiti Nepal
(a non-profit organization) in Nepal, dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking.
Currently, Maiti Nepal operates a rehabilitation home in Kathmandu, as well as transit
homes at the Indo-Nepal border towns, preventive homes in the countryside, and 
an academy in Kathmandu. Maiti Nepal's main office in Kathmandu has been destroyed
twice and Maiti workers must travel with a bodyguard when overseeing rescue missions 
in India.As the name suggests, Maiti Nepal (<I>"maiti"</I> meaning <i>"mother's home"
</i> in Nepali) has been a refuge for women rescued from the brothels in India.The 
women can stay in the homes run by Maiti Nepal until they are able to return to their
 homes or if not accepted by their parents they may stay until they become able to live 
on their own.Maiti Nepal also works on reuniting the rescued women with their families, 
patrolling Indo-Nepal border with police and other law enforcement authorities
and also rescuing trafficked women from the brothels in India with the help 
of Indian authorities.<br>
Anuradha Koirala has been awarded CNN Heroes Award 2010, in Los Angeles, 
California. She was introduced by Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher on the stage.
Koirala received $ 100,000 to continue her work with Maiti Nepal, in addition 
to $ 25,000 as a token of appreciation, from the CNN.<br>
Today she is a widely recognized activist and lecturer who has dedicated her life
