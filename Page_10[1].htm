<font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="lime">Mr. Rudra Lal Mulmi has made important contributions in the history of Nepalese
 journalism. He has been associated with prominent local and foreign media houses
 and agencies like Nepal Sambad Samiitii, Dainik Halkhabar, Diyalo, Pasa, Nepal 
Times, Naya Nepal, Hindustan Khabar, etc. He was member of Nepal Journalist 
Association in 2012 B.S. (1955).
Mr. Mulmi has dedicated his whole life for social service. For nearly four decades he
served as acting secretary in the trust organization- "Gandhi Smarak Nidhi", established
by Tulsi Meher Shrestha and later in "Nepal Charkha Pracharak Gandhi Smarak 
Mahaguthi, " a memorial trust following the ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi. He played 
crucial role for the development and growth of these organizations.
Always ready to help blind, disabled, destitute and oppressed people, Mr. Mulmi not 
only gave support to the children of leprosy patients of Khokana (a village in Lalitpur), 
but also made provision for their education. After demise of famous humanitarian Tulsi 
Meher Shrestha in 2037 B.S., (1980), Mr. Mulmi initiated a shelter home for women in
his memory- Tulsi Meher Mahila Ashram, to provide shelter and support to the helpless, 
destitute, single and disabled women. His contribution towards institutionalizing the social
service sector and inspiring noble deeds is memorable.
