Social service is a professional and academic discipline<br>
that seeks to improve the quality of life and well being of<br>
an individual, group, or community by intervening through<br>
research, policy, community organizing, direct practice, and<br>
teaching on behalf of those afflicted with poverty or any real<br>
or perceived social injustices and violations of their human <br>
rights.Social workers are organized into local, national, <br>
continental and international professional bodies. Social <br>
work, an interdisciplinary field, includes theories from <br>
economics, education, sociology, medicine, philosophy, <br>
politics, anthropology and psychology.
