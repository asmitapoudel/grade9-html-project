<font face="Lucida Calligraphy" color="green" >Dharma Bhakta Mathema was a professional body builder as well as a founding 
member of Praja Parishad party of Nepal. He introduced modern body building 
techniques in Nepal. But he is better known for his contribution to the Nepalese 
struggle for freedom against hereditary prime ministership of the Rana dynasty. 
He was killed during the freedom movement, and he is duly recognized as one of 
the four martyrs of Nepal. His statue is found, along with other three martyrs, in
the Martyr's Gate (Sahid Gate) memorial inKathmandu.<br>
He often went to India to purchase things for the Ranas. He met learned men in
India and understood the importance of education. He received his basic education
in Sanatan Madhyamik Vidhyalaya in Darjeeling, after which he went to the Scottish
Church College in Calcutta to get an Intermediate in Arts (I.A.) degree.<br>
Dharma Bhakta was thin and unhealthy during his childhood, due to which other 
children used to tease and bully him. To put an end to all that, he joined a while in
Calcutta. Constant physical exercise rapidly improved his health. He so excelled 
in bodybuilding that he was announced as "Shree Bengal" (which literally means "
Mr. Bengal") in an all Bengal bodybuilding contest.<br>
After graduating with an I.A. degree from Scottish Church College, he married 
Uttaradevi from Biratnagar. He returned to Kathmandu and established a gym at 
his aunt Yamkumari Ray's house. Many youths of Kathmandu were attracted by 
the novelty of the gym. The gym attracted not only the commoners but also the 
Rana family and the police forces too. Once a troop of German soldiers had come
to Nepal for a visit. He showed his body building tricks and exercises to them in the
presence of Juddha Shumsher. His proficiency easily won their hearts.<br>
Once during the Ghode Jatra festival, he showed his bodybuilding prowess to the 
people in the presence of King Tribhuban and the Rana family in Tundikhel. 
He made different bodybuilding poses and performed many test of strength. For 
instance, he put a long rod on his back and told three to four persons on each side
of the rod to hang. He was then jumping and lifting with those people. In another 
instance he lied down on the ground and told a person to hammer his chest with a 
hammer. People were amazed that he was unharmed. People could not believe that
a man could be so strong. King Tribhuwan was also greatly impressed by his feat, 
so much so such that he was appointed as a physical instructor to the king.
